# Card Payment Integration Fix - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Added Paystack API credentials loading in app.py
- [x] Modified /donate route to handle GET requests with payment success callback
- [x] Implemented verify_paystack_payment() function to verify payment status with Paystack API
- [x] Updated verify_paystack_payment() to find donations by reference or metadata donation_id
- [x] Updated paystack_webhook() to handle card payments using metadata
- [x] Verified card_payment.html template uses correct Paystack inline JS setup

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test card payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Ensure Paystack keys are properly configured in environment
- [ ] Verify webhook URL is configured in Paystack dashboard
- [ ] Test payment verification and database updates
- [ ] Add error handling for failed payments

## Notes
- Card payments use Paystack inline JS for client-side processing
- Payment verification happens via callback to /donate?payment=success&reference=...
- Webhook provides asynchronous payment notifications
- Donation records are updated with payment status and transaction reference
- Metadata includes donation_id for proper record linking
